# **Astoot Commute** #
### Get accurate bus arrival times in Chicago ###

## Usage
 - You can download the code but you will need a Chicago Transit Authority API key.
 - http://www.transitchicago.com/developers/bustracker.aspx

## Technologies Used
 - Astoot Commute was made with Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL on the backend and React and Redux on the frontend.

## Next Steps
 - I plan to connect with the Twilio API and allow users to schedule 'toots' in the form of text messages alerting them to buses arriving at a nearby stop on their regular commute.
